# My Reads

My Reads is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

To install all dependencies run the following command:

```
npm install
```

Then to start the app you need to start the app run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server and run the react app.


## Using the app

The app will allow you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The books you have stored is added to three shelves.

### Mooving books between shelves

To move a book to an other shelf you need to click the green arrow in the lower right corner of the books icon and select what shelf you want to move it to.

### Adding new books

To add a new book you first need to click on the button with a plus sign in the lower right corner of the page. You will then get a search field where you can search for books to add to the list. The search uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
